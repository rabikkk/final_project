Since v. 0.93 the last settings the user made to the GUI are stored in the registry.
If you want to run a new version on your machine, you should clear these settings previously before using the new GUI.
This can be either done by running "HTPA_Unwise.bat" or by deleting the following key in the registry manually:
\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\HeimannSensor\HTPA GUI\Settings
Simply delete the whole key with all the subsidairys.
